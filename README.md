This project is a Flutter-based single-screen module for the S.Rocks.Music app, designed to showcase music services like production, lyrics writing, and mixing. The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns using the BLoC pattern for state management (instead of Provider) and integrates Firebase Firestore to dynamically fetch service data. The folder structure is organized into data (models, repositories, data sources), presentation (bloc, pages, widgets), and a centralized dependency injection setup via get_it. The UI includes custom-styled components like a gradient banner, image-backed service tiles, and a BottomNavigationBar with custom icons.
